/**
 * Pure, fail-closed transformation of legacy path identities into stable folder identities,
 * delegating to [SyncIdentityMigration]. It does not write anything. The caller must coordinate
 * all remote documents, local bases and a durable migration journal before using it in live sync;
 * a partial multi-document migration must never be mistaken for an unrelated new book.
 *
 * Folder positions are page-revision based, so a rewritten record's recomputed content revision
 * cannot be trusted here without the coordinated protocol; revisions therefore abort the
 * migration instead of being recomputed ([SyncIdentityMigration.metadata] with
 * [recomputeRevisions] = false).
