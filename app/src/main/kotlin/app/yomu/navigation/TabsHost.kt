 * one from scratch (its whole list and all its images) in one long frame: that frame was the lag felt on every switch,
 * and the bar's animation stalled with it. Now a tab, once opened, stays composed while another one is on screen, so
 * switching back to it is a layout pass. A tab that was never opened is composed and measured while the finger is
 * still on the bar ([TabsState.prepare] on press), so by the time it lifts the new tab is ready.
 *
 * A tab off screen is not placed: it is not drawn, gets no touches and has no semantics. Its lifecycle stops at
 * STARTED (its data keeps coming, so it is up to date when it comes back; nothing in the tabs waits for "resumed"),
 * its back handlers are switched off and its covers take no part in shared element transitions. Every tab keeps a
 * ViewModel store and saved state of its own, as it had as a destination.
